## :scroll: Description
This is a count down timer app that lets you track multiple timers art once!
Create your timer items with the app's simple and colorful ui and keep track of your time.

You can expand and collapse any timers to see the progress or hide them to save some screen space.

This app makes extensive usage of the new Jetpack Compose Animations API to provide fluid experience.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
This app was made to explore the power of the Jetpack compose in designing fluid motions and dynamic ui components.
So far, I am excited at what I see and can't wait for future releases.
